<p>The Discovery Heatmap fetches every public events from discovery API and refreshes them automatically in the browser every hour.</p>

<p>Events are displayed so the more events are in a location, the more it gets colored. The color scheme begins from a light blue, then purple and when the heat is really high, red.</p>

<p>A user can zoom in and out with the scroll wheel (or finger pinch on a touch screen) and move around the map with mouse drag and drop.</p>

<p>The map is optimised to be displayed in fullscreen. To do so, press the F11 key to activate the fullscreen mode in most modern browsers.</p>
