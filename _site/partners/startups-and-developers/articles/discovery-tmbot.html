<p>Back in June we held our mini-hackathon event, aka devjam, in Los Angeles, to a sold-out audience. One of the key topics at the event was bot creation on the Ticketmaster Open Platform.</p>

<p><a href="https://degratnik.github.io/tmbot/">TMbot</a> is the first bot for Slack that allows you to learn about Ticketmaster events. You can add it to your channel, and anyone on your channel can communicate with the bot.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/partners/startups-development/tmbot.png" alt="bot" /></p>

<p>The bot can find events by using keywords, location or date. If you are a Slack fan, the TMbot is the perfect way to search for entertainment with Ticketmaster without leaving your favorite messenger.</p>

<p>The bot is based on the Discovery API and has been developed with the Botkit library on Node.Js. It is hosted on Heroku. The application is under development, so you are welcome to <a href="https://github.com/degratnik/tmbot">join</a>.</p>
