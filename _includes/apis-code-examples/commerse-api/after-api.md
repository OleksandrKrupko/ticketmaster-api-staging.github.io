<p>In addition to the publically available Commerce API for returning available offers and products, additional APIs exist for the shopping and checkout process.</p>
<p>Shopping APIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cart APIS – APIs that support the ability to create, retrieve, update and delete shopping carts with the products and offers for events</li>
  <li>Delivery Method APIs – APIs that enable an application to get a list of the supported methods of delivery and to select what method of delivery to use for a shopping session</li>
  <li>Methods of Payment APIs – APIs that enable an authenticated user session to get, select or add methods of payments for use in the transaction process.</li>
  <li>Purchase APIs – APIs used to initiate and complete a transaction for a shopping session</li>
<p>Access to these APIs requires a formal business relationship with Ticketmaster – use the Feedback form through Developer.Ticketmaster.com if you’d like to pursue a relationship with Ticketmaster.</p>
