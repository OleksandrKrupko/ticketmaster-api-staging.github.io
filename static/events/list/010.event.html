<p>This talk will give you an introduction to Browserify, a tool that lets you use Node-style CommonJS modules in the browser, and outline some of the benefits of using it with Angular. Then, it will walk through how to actually use Browserify in the real world, including setting up fast development live-reloading, integrating non CommonJS libraries, getting Jasmine unit tests and Istanbul test coverage working, and bundling it all up for production.</p>
